### Hi there 👋

I'm David, an italian Android developer, currently working in Brighton for Bofin, a fintech startup! 🏦

I developed apps with **Kotlin**, Java, React Native and also Flutter but, right now, I'm focusing on learning every secret of Android's world 📱.

I'm learning Jetpack Compose, **Android Jetpack**, Dagger, Flutter, **Material Components** and much more. 🌳 

Among my repositories you can find:
- 🦜 Macaw: an Android app that I'm developing to become familiar with **Jepack Compose**, the new declarative UI framework from Google.
- 🍬 Sweet Bank: an Android app I developed ( and I'm trying to maintain! ) to explore Android Jetpack, Motion Layout, MVVM design pattern and much more
- 🌼 Yellow: a Flutter app that fetches data from Starling Bank's APIs
- ☕️ Coffee Advisor: an old webhook for a Google Assistant app that I released back in the days. It's in Node.js and uses the official libraries of Actions On Google (v2).

You can find my website, email and more info about me in the profile section at left. ✌🏻
