### Hi there 👋

I'm David, an italian Android Enginner, currently working in [Technogym](https://www.technogym.com/), Cesena.

I developed apps with **Kotlin**, Java, React Native and also Flutter but, right now, I'm focusing on learning every secret of Android's world 📱.

I mainly develop in Jetpack Compose, using the **Android Jetpack** suite, Dagger, Flutter, **Material Components** and much more. 🌳 

Currently focused on 🏎️ **Guess The Car** 🏎️, an Android game made with Jetpack Compose: the repo is still private.
 
Among my repositories you can find some old project:
- 🦜 Macaw and 🍟 Foodie : two Android apps that I'm developing to become familiar with **Jepack Compose**, the new declarative UI framework from Google, and **Material You**, the new design kit and guideline for Android apps.
- 🍬 Sweet Bank: an Android app I developed using Android Jetpack, Dagger, Retrofit, Moshi, Motion Layout, MVVM design pattern and much more
- 🌼 Yellow: a Flutter app that fetches data from Starling Bank's APIs
- ☕️ Coffee Advisor: an old webhook for a Google Assistant app that I released back in the university days. It's in Node.js and uses the official libraries of Actions On Google (v2).

You can find my website, email and more info about me in the profile section at left. ✌🏻
